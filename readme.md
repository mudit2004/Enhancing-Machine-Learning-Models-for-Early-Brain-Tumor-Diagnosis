## Abstract
Brain tumors, classified broadly as glioma (malignant) and meningeal tumor (non-malignant), present a grave threat by damaging and compressing vital parts of the brain. Traditional diagnostic methods often prove time-consuming, impeding prompt treatment. This project endeavors to expedite tumor detection using machine learning methodologies. Leveraging a dataset featuring metabolite profiles specific to glioma (categorized by grade) and meningeal tumors, ten diverse machine learning models are trained and rigorously tested. These models include Naive Bayes (NB), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Logistic Regression (LR), Fast Large Margin (FLM), Deep Learning (DL), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Evolutionary Heterogeneous Decision Tree (EvoHDTree). Through rigorous evaluation based on performance metrics such as Area Under the Curve (AUC), Accuracy (ACC), and F1-score, these models are compared for their efficacy in discriminating between healthy individuals and those afflicted with carcinoma. Furthermore, the top-performing EvoHDTree model (with an ACC of 0.9195) undergoes enhancement through the novel application of the ADASYN up-sampling algorithm during preprocessing. This augmentation yields the ultimate model capable of distinguishing between malignant and non-malignant tumors with heightened accuracy.
